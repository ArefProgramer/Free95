Remarks

Kap Petrov:
    I'd say this version's mouse polling system is buggy, it can fuck up from the keyboard, and because
    of the polling nature, processes will not run unless mouse is being actively moved. In cavemen terms,
    this version is fucking retarded.

Vincent392 (RE TO KAP):
    Fuck, someone is gotta fix that.

Kap Petrov (RE TO VINCENT):
    Surprise surprise, that's fucking me, because none of yall are fucking contributing shit.
